## Backlight 
One of the two ways to illuminate a screen. This kind of illumiation is the one present on 100% of screens (excluding eInk screens). See Frontlight to know about the aternative illumination

## Blue light
One of the colours proyected off from a screen with backlight, which has a spectre of light that affects us in a different way than the other colours. In the last years it started to become a concern for people who work all day with a computer and appeared special glasses to block it, as it stimulates some brain activity after a few hours of use, provocking difficulty to sleep, plus other effects.

## Colour deepth
Measured in bits, it means how many million colours will your monitor show. For someone with eyestrain, usually the less is the better. 24 or 32 bits (and in some cases also 16) of colours implies the use of a technique called dithering (see below), which plays an important role in eyestrain. This parameter can be set on any Operatin system on screen configuration, and also on TV. Some monitors/TV are capable of displaying more bits than others. You should check your display configuration and check how many bits is capable of. The parameter can be 6, 8, 10 or 12, being that number how many bits per colour channel (RGB)

## Digital vibrance
Dithering technique used by Nvidia and Ati to create more million colours to show. At a high levels it can cause sever eyestrain in some minutes to people who never had it even after playing for many hours in the worst illumination conditions

## Dithering
One of the major causes of eyestrain. This is a strategy which uses ultrafast colour changing pixels to cheat the eye obtaining a colour that was not suppossed to be possible of being displayed by the screen. The translation of pixels happens at a speed the eye can notice it, but some people get his/her neurological system stressed

## FRC
Frame rate control. Used to dither. Be aware of the specification of your monitor/TV, because it can state it has 8bits of colour when on reality it has 6bits+FRC to achieve that 2 extra bits

## Flicker
When an eye unperceptible intermitency of the blacklight is used to dim the brightness, causing eyestrain. See PWM to further information

## Frontlight
One of the two ways to add illumiation to a screen. In this case, this illumination is the one always attached to eInk screens, if any. is much less aggressive than backlight due not having the light coming from behind the screen towards your eyes, as with blacklight. With frontlight the light comes from the borders of the screen, trapped behind a special layer which makes it travel through all the surface

## PWM
Pulse width modulation. Along with dithering, those are the two major causes of eyestrain. It's the way, since appearence of led screen illumination, most of screens (phones, tablets, monitors, TV) dims the brightness. Its process is simple: when brightness is at 100%, the leds are on an always-on configuration, but when it's dimmed, the leds blink at an ultra fast speed unnoticiable for the brain, staying in an OFF position for more fractions of second as more you dim the brightness. Some screens uses PWM at the very first moment you dim it, others only at a low birghtness, and other don't use PWM at all due they use a direct/analog current dimming method
